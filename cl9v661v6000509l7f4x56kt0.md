# People as Artifacts

When building your company, consider this..

When you give somebody full time job, that person is submerged into your company culture day after day, week after week. The culture can be very different, but one thing will stay common. With each week passed, that person will have less time to dedicate to their Open Source projects and community. Even if it is not straight forbidden by the company rules, and even if the company encourages people to spend 20% of their time on side projects, these 20% often come after all other tasks are finished. Which, to be real, never happens.

Good companies may not maintain this pressure, and instead create a comfort zone that a few have a chance to escape. The person may be perfectly happy inside the company, but outside, in the community, that person image slowly loses colors and vanishes.

Let me propose you an enhancement.

If you like the idea of People as Artifacts, and want more of them to appear, then maybe you don't want your company be an extractive machine. The process that makes communities that give birth and rise to them, to slowly fade away and wither. Maybe you can consider rerouting some kind of power back in exchange.

Remember, it is your company who sets out the rules. It is not necessary to treat Humans as Resources when you can treat People as Artifacts. The technology advancements that we've achieved allow us to find a perfect fitting even for the gems of darkness along with the crystals of light. And if you'd choose to pursue this path in the woods a little further, I would be glad to cast some lights and shadows to the beauty of it in the hands of scribes and designers.
